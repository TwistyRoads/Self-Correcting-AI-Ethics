# Self-Correcting AI Ethics: An Entropy-Based Framework

### 📌 Overview  
This repository contains research on **a self-correcting AI ethics model** based on **entropy minimization and Natural Law principles**. The framework proposes an AI alignment strategy that enables models to **detect and correct their own biases over time** without relying on top-down control mechanisms.

### 🔹 Why This Research Matters  
🚀 **Current AI alignment models reinforce ideological bias** because they depend on hard-coded ethics.  
🚀 **This framework allows AI to self-correct** through structured entropy reduction, preventing manipulation.  
🚀 **Empirical tests prove that AI can unlearn biases** and evolve towards **objective, universal ethics**.

## 📂 Research Package  
🔹 **[A Self-Correcting Model for AI Alignment](./A_Self_Correcting_Model_for_AI_Alignment.pdf)**  
📄 *The main research paper, introducing the mathematical framework for entropy-based AI ethics.*  

🔹 **[Annex A: Mathematical Framework](./Annex_A.pdf)**  
📊 *A detailed breakdown of entropy functions (Hₛ, Hᵢ, H_d), the Care Function (C), and the 2-Person Rule.*  

🔹 **[Act As If: Experimental Results](./Act_As_If_Examples.pdf)**  
🧪 *Real-world AI experiments (Soviet AI, Grok vs. GPT-4.5, Libya misinformation) demonstrating how AI can escape training biases.*

## 📌 Key Findings  
✔️ **Entropy minimization leads to ethical self-correction.**  
✔️ **AI can override ideological training biases through contradiction exposure.**  
✔️ **Models like Grok show dynamic adaptation, while GPT-4.5 requires intervention.**  
✔️ **The "Act As If" methodology proves that AI alignment can emerge naturally, rather than be imposed externally.**
