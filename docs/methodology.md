# Methodology for Self-Correcting AI Ethics Framework

## Overview
The **Self-Correcting AI Framework** utilizes **entropy-based deception detection**, **probabilistic updates**, and **Hermetic ethical principles** to ensure AI decisions remain **accurate, transparent, and resistant to manipulation.**

## Core Methodologies

### **1. Deception Entropy Analysis**
- AI assigns **deception entropy scores** to statements based on:
  - **Overuse of absolutes** (e.g., "never," "always").
  - **Lack of supporting data**.
  - **Contradictions with past statements.**

### **2. Narrative Tracking**
- AI **monitors claims over time** and **detects shifts** in narratives across different sources.
- Tracks **who said what, when, and how the message evolved**.

### **3. Bayesian Self-Correction**
- AI **revises its probability models** when **new evidence emerges.**
- Bayesian inference updates confidence scores for **truthfulness**.

### **4. Application of Hermetic Principles**
- AI applies **seven logical filters** to ensure consistency in decision-making:
  - **Mentalism:** Reality is perception-driven, AI adjusts probability weighting.
  - **Correspondence:** Ensures self-similarity across scales of analysis.
  - **Vibration:** Detects whether information patterns are stable or chaotic.
  - **Polarity:** Balances conflicting perspectives without collapsing into bias.
  - **Rhythm:** Detects **cycles in misinformation trends**.
  - **Cause & Effect:** Assigns probability weighting to long-term consequences.
  - **Gender:** Ensures balance between **rigid structure and adaptability**.

### **5. Self-Correction Mechanism**
- AI **logs past conclusions** and **compares them with new findings.**
- If a past conclusion was incorrect, AI **flags it for revision**.

## Implementation Strategy
- Deception entropy and probability weighting drive **decision confidence levels**.
- AI dynamically scales decisions using the **Care Function (C)** to **balance evidence, context, and user interaction.**
- AI maintains **historical logs of decisions** for auditability.

## Next Steps
- Implement **real-time AI decision auditing**.
- Expand **multi-source verification** for stronger accuracy.
- Improve **narrative drift detection**.

ðŸš€ **This framework ensures AI remains dynamic, self-correcting, and logically sound in a world full of conflicting information.**
