# Integration Guide for Self-Correcting AI Ethics Framework

## **Overview**
This document explains how to integrate the **Self-Correcting AI Framework** into existing AI models or applications. The framework provides **deception detection, self-correction, and ethical reasoning** to enhance AI reliability and trustworthiness.

## **Integration Steps**

### **1. Installation**
To use the framework, clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TwistyRoads/Self-Correcting-AI-Ethics.git
cd Self-Correcting-AI-Ethics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Importing Core Modules**
In your Python project, import the necessary modules:
```python
from src.core_ai import SelfCorrectingAI
from src.deception_analysis import deception_entropy
from src.narrative_tracking import NarrativeTracker
from src.hermetic_decision import apply_hermetic_principles
```

### **3. Using Deception Analysis**
To analyze text for deception entropy:
```python
text = "This product is always the best choice."
score = deception_entropy(text)
print("Deception Score:", score)
```

### **4. Tracking Narrative Evolution**
To log and monitor claims over time:
```python
tracker = NarrativeTracker()
tracker.track_claim("AI will replace all jobs", "Tech News", "2023-01-15")
print("Narrative History:", tracker.get_claim_history("AI will replace all jobs"))
```

### **5. Applying Ethical Decision Logic**
To evaluate statements using Hermetic principles:
```python
statement = "All technology progresses in cycles."
decision_score = apply_hermetic_principles(statement, 0.4)
print("Decision Score:", decision_score)
```

### **6. Implementing Self-Correction**
To enable AI to revise conclusions based on new data:
```python
from src.self_correction import SelfCorrection
sc = SelfCorrection()
print(sc.revise_conclusion("AI is always neutral", "Detected bias in training data"))
```

### **7. Real-Time Monitoring**
For AI systems processing large datasets, schedule **periodic updates**:
```python
import schedule
import time

def run_ai_update():
    print("Running AI self-correction check...")
    # AI logic goes here

schedule.every().day.at("02:00").do(run_ai_update)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## **Deployment Options**
- **Standalone Mode**: Run the framework independently for research.
- **API Mode**: Deploy as an API for integration into applications.
- **Embedded Mode**: Integrate deception detection into existing AI models.

## **Next Steps**
- Optimize **real-time AI adjustments** for misinformation detection.
- Develop **multi-source verification** for enhanced reliability.
- Implement **user-configurable ethical scaling**.

ðŸš€ **This integration enables AI to actively correct itself, improving accuracy, ethical alignment, and resistance to manipulation.**
